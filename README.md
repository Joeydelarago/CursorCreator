# CursorCreator
Creates an x11 cursor file for linux operating systems from a video. 


## Usage

```bash
python3 main.py INPUT_VIDEO_FILE_PATH
```

## Notes
The clickgen library seems to be broken at the moment, the generated icons do not animate.

This has only been tested with .mp4 video file inputs.


## Examples
In the examples folder there is a cursor of the entire Morbius movie trailer.
